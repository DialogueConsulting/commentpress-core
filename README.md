CommentPress Core
=================

This is the ConsultNow platform's fork of the CommentPress Core plugin & themes. 

From the CommentPress Core docs:

*CommentPress Core* is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line or block-by-block in the margins of a text.

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with CommentPress Core you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog. Use it in combination with BuddyPress and BuddyPress Groupblog to create communities around your documents.
