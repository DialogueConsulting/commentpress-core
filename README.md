CommentPress Core
=================

This is the ConsultNow platform's fork of the CommentPress Core plugin & themes. 

Some changes to WCAG compliance, plus addition of social sharing (using the [AddThis plugin for Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/addthis/) which is at least s508 accessibility compliant) and a few other bits & bobs to improve speed & scalability. We also recommend using it in production with the great [WP Accessiblity plugin](http://www.joedolson.com/articles/wp-accessibility/) which further improves accessible browsing.

Specific docs/readme is potentially on its way, if there is community interest. In the meantime, [read the CommentPress docs for more information about how to implement the plugin](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/).

From the CommentPress Core docs:

*CommentPress Core* is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line or block-by-block in the margins of a text.

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with CommentPress Core you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog. Use it in combination with BuddyPress and BuddyPress Groupblog to create communities around your documents.
